About
-----

JSXGraph is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting,
charting, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely
in JavaScript, does not rely on any other library, and uses SVG, VML, or canvas.
JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: less than 100 KByte if
embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! Special care has been taken
to optimize the performance.

Starting with version 0.80, JSXGraph supports multitouch devices like the Apple
iPad. Since version 0.82 the canvas element is supported, too. That means,
JSXGraph also runs on Android devices.

JSXGraph is developed at the
Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mathematik und ihre Didaktik
University of Bayreuth, Germany

Build JSXGraph
--------------

In order to build JSXGraph you need Python 2 or later, YUI Compressor 2.x.x or
later, and to build the reference docs you need jsdoc-toolkit 2.3.2 or later.

To build JSXGraph core type

    $ python make.py --yui=/path/to/yui --output=/output/dir Core

This will concatenate all core files (basically all .js files in src/ except
loadjsxgraph.js and {Geonext,GeoGebra,Cinderella,Graph,Intergeo}Reader.js),
strip all comments and minify the file into /output/dir/jsxgraphcore.js.


Usage
-----

Include jsxgraphcore.js and, if required, one or more *Reader.js in your HTML
file. For further usage instructions please consult our wiki

    http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/

especially our tutorials located at

    http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Documentation
