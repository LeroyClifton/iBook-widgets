## Exercise Framework

Khan Academy has created a generic framework for building exercises. This framework, together with the exercises themselves, can be used completely independently of the Khan Academy application.

The framework exists in two components:

* An HTML markup for specifying exercises.
* A jQuery plugin for generating a usable, interactive, exercise from the HTML markup.

## Writing Exercises

The process for writing exercises is rather well documented. More information about this process can be found in the [Khan Exercises wiki](https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/wiki). Specifically:

* [How to Get Involved](https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/wiki/Getting-Involved)
* [How to Write Exercises](https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/wiki/Writing-Exercises:-Home)
* [How to Test Exercises](https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/wiki/Testing-Exercises)
